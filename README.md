# python-security-utils
Learning Security using python at first as a soon to be CS major
This will be my first github repo im just going to add my already existing projects here and continue striving towards my next goal which will be a log_parser. As of right now i have some knowledge of python and my code will just be here for possible later usage.
If you use my code got for it i could not care less i do not believe that it would be useful to anyone on github as they are way more advanced then i am.
Have fun reading through my awful code im probably going to come back to this at some point and cry myself to sleep seing this awful code.

print("Hello World")

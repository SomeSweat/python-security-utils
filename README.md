# python-security-utils
I wrote this code for just own practice to understand python better. Which hopefully someday will turn into a proper job.
Learning Security using python at first as a soon to be CS major.
This will be my first github repo im just going to add my already existing projects here and continue striving towards my next goal which will be a log_parser. As of right now i have some knowledge of python and my code will just be here for possible later usage.
If you use my code got for it i could not care less i do not believe that it would be useful to anyone on github as they are way more advanced then i am.
Have fun reading through my awful code im probably going to come back to this at some point and cry myself to sleep seing this awful code.
My maxlist.py just finds the highest number in a random generated list from 1-100000 based on user input.
The s.py file is a grade average calculator that rounds the average to the last 2 decimal points(eg. 2.55).
And my newest project which is the todo.py is just a todo list where you can add, view and remove tasks.
As of right now i am working on an expense tracker after which i will actually turn the code into usable apps not just terminal/cmd usage. Or i might start working on a new repo depends on where the wind will take me.

print("Hello World")
